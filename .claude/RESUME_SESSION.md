# Session Recovery State

This file tracks the current session state to enable seamless recovery between sessions or after a crash. Update after every material change.

## Last Updated
2026-07-31 (end of 2026-07-30/31 session — GEO re-audit + Wikidata dead-link fix + hotfix bundle + OBR-KHNSIC scope broadening + vault sweep)

## Current Branch
`feature/update-homepage` — 3 commits ahead of `main` (main is at `5e5c0da` from 2026-06-18)

## Latest commits (2026-07-30 arc)
- **`086a8ae`** — "Broaden site language to reflect OBR-registered KHNSIC scope" — deploy `dpl_6pcc9sZ1FJfj2raqN1mirnjEnBsQ` (HEAD)
- **`c9e9690`** — "Post-audit hotfix bundle: GitHub sameAs, 404 robots, sitemap freshness, DASP breadcrumb" — deploy `dpl_Cwh1WkcScRg69mmKBY52VB2uwUaN`
- **`ca32875`** — "Remove dead Wikidata sameAs anchor (Q140279044 was deleted 2026-06-28)" — deploy `dpl_6LPAHGBd6qCcKL9sjcihTZCdPt3N`

All three commits pushed to `feature/update-homepage`. **`main` has NOT been fast-forwarded yet** — pending Bill sign-off.

## What just happened (2026-07-30 arc, one session)

### Phase 8 — Post-DPI-repositioning GEO re-audit (composite 63 → 67)

Ran full 5-subagent re-audit ~6 weeks after 2026-06-18 DPI ship. Composite **67/100 (Fair — upper band, approaching Good)**, +4 vs 63 baseline.

Per-category deltas: Citability 78→77 (−1), Brand 42→43 (+1), E-E-A-T 68→73 (**+5, biggest**), Technical 88→91 (+3), Schema 82→77 (−5, dateModified staleness), Platform 30→35 (+5, GBP win).

**CRITICAL discovery**: Wikidata Q140279044 was DELETED by admin `MisterSynergy` on **2026-06-28** — 10 days after Bill created it. Reason: notability failure. Production HTML had been emitting the now-404 URL for 33 days.

### Same-day hotfix arc (3 commits, all shipped)

- **C1 hotfix** (`ca32875`): Removed dead Wikidata URL from `Organization.sameAs`. Deploy required interactive `vercel login` re-auth (token had expired).
- **L1+H1+H2+M1 bundle** (`c9e9690`): Added GitHub URL to sameAs (2 anchors restored); overrode 404 robots metadata; added `revalidate = 86400` to sitemap.ts; fixed DASP BreadcrumbList self-loop.
- **OBR-KHNSIC scope broadening** (`086a8ae`): Bill submitted CamFinTech to Cambodian OBR portal with 5 KHNSIC-2015 codes. Site language broadened to reflect 4 public codes (62020, 62090, 70200, 85499). 62010 (software dev/SaaS) kept OFF public site to preserve "never build" hard rule. Locked via AskUserQuestion: single-brand front door, no CamFinTech Group umbrella, no Angkor Skills Academy mention until angkorskillsacademy.com launches. Plan file: `/Users/myownip/.config/claude/plans/misty-cuddling-gray.md`.

### Vault + memory sweep (2026-07-31)

- **[[GEO Audit 2026-07-30]]** — new snapshot in website vault
- **Rewrite Project.md** — 3 sprint log entries (re-audit + hotfix + OBR broadening)
- **Outstanding Issues.md** — reconciled against 2026-07-30 audit; historical content preserved for provenance
- **Recent Milestones.md** — new "Phase 7" section with 2026-06-18 → 2026-07-30 entries
- **GEO and SEO Strategy.md** — 2026-07-30 row added; pre-DPI baseline callout updated
- **README.md** — bumped to 67/100 baseline; OBR row added
- **DPI Integration/00_README.md** — new "OBR company registration submitted (2026-07-30)" section
- **DPI Integration/61_CamFinTech_Website_Rewrite_Brief.md** — addendum note added at top
- **DPI Integration/63_OBR_Registration_and_KHNSIC_Scope.md** — NEW canonical doc for OBR filing + decision log
- **MEMORY.md** (auto-memory) — Wikidata marked DELETED; GitHub added to sameAs anchors; GBP still LIVE with wire-up pending; new "Group structure" section; OBR submission details in Legal Entity; 2026-07-30 audit added; string collision worsened
- **This file** — full rewrite

## Expected next audit composite

**~70/100** once AI crawlers re-index (2-4 weeks). This assumes:
- Wikidata dead-link removed (done)
- GitHub URL in sameAs (done)
- Sitemap freshness restored (done)
- 404 robots contradiction resolved (done — behaviorally)
- DASP breadcrumb clean (done)
- KHNSIC scope broadening reaches AI crawlers via llms.txt + knowsAbout expansion (in progress)

## Pending tasks (Bill-actionable)

Priority order for the 30-day target (composite ≥ 72 by 2026-08-30):

| # | Item | Effort | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Send GBP Maps URL + lat/lng** | 2 min Bill · 3 min Claude follow-up | Bill only |
| 2 | **FU-6**: real founder bio + headshot for `/about` | Bill content · Claude drops in | Bill content — SINGLE BIGGEST E-E-A-T LIFT STILL ON TABLE |
| 3 | **H4**: Hyperlink 8-12 primary sources (Prakas 093, TCRMG, NBFSA plan, Digital Gov Policy, Law on Taxation, BIS 2024, NBC AR 2024) | 2 hours Claude | Nothing |
| 4 | **HSTS preload submission** at hstspreload.org | 5 min Bill | Bill only — header already qualifies |
| 5 | **GSC: request indexing** for `/`, `/about`, `/products/dasp`, `/publication` | 5 min Bill | Bill only |
| 6 | **CAFT membership** application (caftkh.org was 503 on 2026-06-18) | Bill | Bill only — retry |
| 7 | **LinkedIn 1-3 posts** re-sharing Riel Report briefings | Bill | Bill only |
| 8 | **M4/M5/M6**: Small copy polish (homepage "What is CamFinTech?" answer block; /glossary/camdigikey lead sentence; /about full street address) | 30 min Claude | Nothing |
| 9 | **NEW-M1 cosmetic residue**: 404 page still emits 2 robots meta tags (both agree noindex now — behavior correct, redundancy remains) | 15 min Claude — investigate app/layout.tsx | Nothing |
| 10 | **`main` fast-forward**: bring `main` up to `086a8ae` for GitHub default-branch hygiene | 2 min | Bill sign-off |
| 11 | **2-week re-audit** on/after 2026-08-13 | Run `/geo-audit` | Nothing |

## Longer-horizon follow-ups

- **FU-1/2/3/4**: Reconcile Riel Report side (riel.report/about, briefing footer boilerplate, LinkedIn bios still carry old "Phnom Penh software company" framing). Bill operational.
- **FU-7**: Write 7 TCRMG posture docs (~6.5 hours per FinTechReport vault 37) — gates Phase 4 `/approach` page
- **When OBR certificate issues**: mechanical swap across `/about`, Footer, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `JsonLd.tsx` `legalName` to remove "pending registration" language. See vault [[../DPI Integration/63_OBR_Registration_and_KHNSIC_Scope]] §8.
- **When angkorskillsacademy.com launches**: introduce ASA as sibling brand in Footer + JsonLd `sameAs` + EducationalOrganization schema. See vault §9.
- **Wikidata rebuild**: NOT before Month 3 of off-site programme. Requires 3+ verifiable independent external mentions before survival is likely.
- **Phase 4 product pages**: `/products/mlro-support` + `/products/ekyc-build` (gated on validation-sprint signal + FU-7)

## Vault state (2026-07-31)

Primary path: `/Users/myownip/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Obsidian/Research/CamFinTech.com/` (iCloud; moved from OneDrive 2026-07-07). Symlink alias: `~/ObsidianVaults/Research/CamFinTech.com/`. OneDrive copy still exists but is legacy — iCloud is authoritative.

| `FinTechReport/12 - Session Timeline.md` | Unchanged — no new entry needed |
| `Angkor Skills Academy/` (folder exists, 7 items) | Not touched this session — awaits site launch trigger |

## Auto-memory state (2026-07-31)

`/Users/myownip/.config/claude/projects/-Users-myownip-workspace-cambodia-fintech/memory/MEMORY.md` — refreshed this session. Now includes:
- Legal Entity section: OBR submission + 5 KHNSIC codes + public/private split decision
- **New Group structure section**: sibling brands (Riel Report + ASA) attribution rules; no umbrella language
- External Entity IDs: Wikidata marked DELETED with errata + rebuild rule; GitHub now in Organization.sameAs; GBP still pending wire-up; Cámara Argentina Fintech string-collision worsened
- GEO Audits: 2026-06-18 post-rewrite (63) + 2026-07-30 (67) entries added; Aston Hill guardrail carried; Wikidata rebuild rule added
- 30-day target updated: composite ≥ 72 by 2026-08-30

## How to resume

1. Read this file first
2. `git log --oneline -10` to see commit history — should show `086a8ae` at HEAD of `feature/update-homepage`, `5e5c0da` at HEAD of `main`
3. `git status` to check for uncommitted changes (should be clean modulo `.claude/RESUME_SESSION.md`)
4. Read auto-memory `MEMORY.md` for cross-session state
5. Check `Research/CamFinTech.com/CamFinTech.com website/Rewrite Project.md` for the live sprint log
6. Bill's next likely ask: send GBP Maps URL + lat/lng OR run the 2-week re-audit on/after 2026-08-13 OR real founder bio for /about (FU-6)

## Hard rules to preserve (from CLAUDE.md + DPI Integration vault)

- Deploy method is `vercel --prod` CLI only (NOT Git auto-deploy — Hobby plan blocks non-team commit authors)
- Production branch in Vercel dashboard: `main` (working branch `feature/update-homepage`)
- Founder display name: William Mallett; LinkedIn slug: `william-mall` (mismatch intentional — do NOT "fix")
- **Aston Hill is NOT associated with CamFinTech** — see GEO Audit errata; do NOT re-introduce
- DPI positioning is canonical: fee-only · never hold client funds · never operate a rail · reserved work to licensed partners · process competence not access
- **62010 (software development / SaaS) stays OFF the public site** — OBR-registered but legal-umbrella breadth only; preserves "never build" hard rule
- **Single-brand front door on camfintech.com** — no "CamFinTech Group" umbrella language
- **No Angkor Skills Academy mention until angkorskillsacademy.com is live** — decided 2026-07-30
- CamDL is a back-end dependency, NOT a sellable rail
- Soft mandates (CamInvoice B2B, PDP law) framed as "get ahead of", never "you're in breach"
- Pricing is indicative; never a quote
- Bill colour-blind: avoid red/green pairings in any visual output
- CO., LTD suffix NOT publicly used until OBR certificate issues
- Wikidata rebuild: NOT before 3+ verifiable independent external mentions exist

## Deployment status

- **Production URL**: https://www.camfintech.com
- **Last deploy**: `dpl_6pcc9sZ1FJfj2raqN1mirnjEnBsQ` (2026-07-30) — OBR-KHNSIC scope broadening
- **Verified live**: knowsAbout + serviceType arrays expanded; KHNSIC section in llms-full.txt renders; prohibited-string sweep clean (no "software development" / "SaaS product" leak); all 5 hard rules intact; Wikidata URL removed from sameAs; sitemap lastmod fresh
- **Vercel project**: `cambodia-fintech` (team `fin-tec-consulting-cambodia`)
- **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/myownipgit/cambodia-fintech (PUBLIC since 2026-06-18)
- **Vercel CLI**: last re-auth 2026-07-30 (browser OAuth via `vercel login`)
